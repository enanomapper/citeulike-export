    abstract = {The Ontology for Biomedical Investigations (OBI) is an ontology that provides terms with precisely defined meanings to describe all aspects of how investigations in the biological and medical domains are conducted. OBI re-uses ontologies that provide a representation of biomedical knowledge from the Open Biological and Biomedical Ontologies (OBO) project and adds the ability to describe how this knowledge was derived. We here describe the state of OBI and several applications that are using it, such as adding semantic expressivity to existing databases, building data entry forms, and enabling interoperability between knowledge resources. OBI covers all phases of the investigation process, such as planning, execution and reporting. It represents information and material entities that participate in these processes, as well as roles and functions. Prior to OBI, it was not possible to use a single internally consistent resource that could be applied to multiple types of experiments for these applications. OBI has made this possible by creating terms for entities involved in biological and medical investigations and by importing parts of other biomedical ontologies such as GO, Chemical Entities of Biological Interest (ChEBI) and Phenotype Attribute and Trait Ontology (PATO) without altering their meaning. OBI is being used in a wide range of projects covering genomics, multi-omics, immunology, and catalogs of services. OBI has also spawned other ontologies (Information Artifact Ontology) and methods for importing parts of ontologies (Minimum information to reference an external ontology term (MIREOT)). The OBI project is an open cross-disciplinary collaborative effort, encompassing multiple research communities from around the globe. To date, OBI has created 2366 classes and 40 relations along with textual and formal definitions. The OBI Consortium maintains a web resource (http://obi-ontology.org) providing details on the people, policies, and issues being addressed in association with OBI. The current release of OBI is available at http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/obi.owl.},

    abstract = {Nanoparticles of various types are of increasing research and technological importance in biological and other applications. Difficulties in the production and delivery of nanoparticles with consistent and well defined properties appear in many forms and have a variety of causes. Among several issues are those associated with incomplete information about the history of particles involved in research studies, including the synthesis method, sample history after synthesis, including time and nature of storage, and the detailed nature of any sample processing or modification. In addition, the tendency of particles to change with time or environmental condition suggests that the time between analysis and application is important and some type of consistency or verification process can be important. The essential history of a set of particles can be identified as provenance information and tells the origin or source of a batch of nano-objects along with information related to handling and any changes that may have taken place since it was originated. A record of sample provenance information for a set of particles can play a useful role in identifying some of the sources and decreasing the extent of particle variability and the lack of reproducibility observed by many researchers.},

The naming revolution is speerheaded by the ” young” field of nanosafety, where harmonisation of terminology is crucial for the development of a database of nanosafety data - and it is needed fast.

    abstract = {ABSTRACTIntroduction: Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are highly adaptive nonlinear optimization algorithms that have been applied in many diverse scientific endeavors, ranging from economics, engineering, physics, and chemistry to medical science. Notably, in the past two decades, ANNs have been used widely in the process of drug discovery.Areas covered: In this review, the authors discuss advantages and disadvantages of ANNs in drug discovery as incorporated into the quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR) framework. Furthermore, the authors examine the recent studies, which span over a broad area with various diseases in drug discovery. In addition, the authors attempt to answer the question about the expectations of the ANNs in drug discovery and discuss the trends in this field.Expert opinion: The old pitfalls of overtraining and interpretability are still present with ANNs. However, despite these pitfalls, the authors believe that ANNs have likely met many of the expectations of researchers and are still considered as excellent tools for nonlinear data modeling in QSAR. It is likely that ANNs will continue to be used in drug development in the future.},

    abstract = {AbstractWithin EU FP7 project NANOVALID, the (eco)toxicity of 7 well-characterized engineered nanomaterials (NMs) was evaluated by 15 bioassays in 4 laboratories. The highest tested nominal concentration of NMs was 100?mg/l. The panel of the bioassays yielded the following toxicity order: Ag?>?ZnO?>?CuO?>?TiO2?>?MWCNTs?>?SiO2?>?Au. Ag, ZnO and CuO proved very toxic in the majority of assays, assumingly due to dissolution. The latter was supported by the parallel analysis of the toxicity of respective soluble metal salts. The most sensitive tests/species were Daphnia magna (towards Ag NMs, 24-h EC50?=?0.003?mg Ag/l), algae Raphidocelis subcapitata (ZnO and CuO, 72-h EC50?=?0.14?mg Zn/l and 0.7?mg Cu/l, respectively) and murine fibroblasts BALB/3T3 (CuO, 48-h EC50?=?0.7?mg Cu/l). MWCNTs showed toxicity only towards rat alveolar macrophages (EC50?=?15.3?mg/l) assumingly due to high aspect ratio and TiO2 towards R. subcapitata (EC50?=?6.8?mg Ti/l) due to agglomeration of TiO2 and entrapment of algal cells. Finally, we constructed a decision tree to select the bioassays for hazard ranking of NMs. For NM testing, we recommend a multitrophic suite of 4 in vitro (eco)toxicity assays: 48-h D. magna immobilization (OECD202), 72-h R. subcapitata growth inhibition (OECD201), 30-min Vibrio fischeri bioluminescence inhibition (ISO2010) and 48-h murine fibroblast BALB/3T3 neutral red uptake in vitro (OECD129) representing crustaceans, algae, bacteria and mammalian cells, respectively. Notably, our results showed that these assays, standardized for toxicity evaluation of ?regular? chemicals, proved efficient also for shortlisting of hazardous NMs. Additional assays are recommended for immunotoxicity evaluation of high aspect ratio NMs (such as MWCNTs).},

    abstract = {Nanotechnology is of increasing significance. Curation of nanomaterial data into electronic databases offers opportunities to better understand and predict nanomaterials' behaviour. This supports innovation in, and regulation of, nanotechnology. It is commonly understood that curated data need to be sufficiently complete and of sufficient quality to serve their intended purpose. However, assessing data completeness and quality is non-trivial in general and is arguably especially difficult in the nanoscience area, given its highly multidisciplinary nature. The current article, part of the Nanomaterial Data Curation Initiative series, addresses how to assess the completeness and quality of (curated) nanomaterial data. In order to address this key challenge, a variety of related issues are discussed: the meaning and importance of data completeness and quality, existing approaches to their assessment and the key challenges associated with evaluating the completeness and quality of curated nanomaterial data. Considerations which are specific to the nanoscience area and lessons which can be learned from other relevant scientific disciplines are considered. Hence, the scope of this discussion ranges from physicochemical characterisation requirements for nanomaterials and interference of nanomaterials with nanotoxicology assays to broader issues such as minimum information checklists, toxicology data quality schemes and computational approaches that facilitate evaluation of the completeness and quality of (curated) data. This discussion is informed by a literature review and a survey of key nanomaterial data curation stakeholders. Finally, drawing upon this discussion, recommendations are presented concerning the central question: how should the completeness and quality of curated nanomaterial data be evaluated?},

    abstract = {AbstractThe number of engineered nanomaterials (ENMs) being exploited commercially is growing rapidly, due to the novel properties they exhibit. Clearly, it is important to understand and minimize any risks to health or the environment posed by the presence of ENMs. Data-driven models that decode the relationships between the biological activities of ENMs and their physicochemical characteristics provide an attractive means of maximizing the value of scarce and expensive experimental data. Although such structure-activity relationship (SAR) methods have become very useful tools for modelling nanotoxicity endpoints (nanoSAR), they have limited robustness and predictivity and, most importantly, interpretation of the models they generate is often very difficult. New computational modelling tools or new ways of using existing tools are required to model the relatively sparse and sometimes lower quality data on the biological effects of ENMs. The most commonly used SAR modelling methods work best with large data sets, are not particularly good at feature selection, can be relatively opaque to interpretation, and may not account for nonlinearity in the structure-property relationships. To overcome these limitations, we describe the application of a novel algorithm, a genetic programming-based decision tree construction tool (GPTree) to nanoSAR modelling. We demonstrate the use of GPTree in the construction of accurate and interpretable nanoSAR models by applying it to four diverse literature datasets. We describe the algorithm and compare model results across the four studies. We show that GPTree generates models with accuracies equivalent to or superior to those of prior modelling studies on the same datasets. GPTree is a robust, automatic method for generation of accurate nanoSAR models with important advantages that it works with small datasets, automatically selects descriptors, and provides significantly improved interpretability of models.},

    abstract = {As an extension of the conventional quantitative structure activity relationship models, proteochemometric (PCM) modelling is a computational method that can predict the bioactivity relations between multiple ligands and multiple targets. Traditional PCM modelling includes three essential elements: descriptors (including target descriptors, ligand descriptors and cross-term descriptors), bioactivity data and appropriate learning functions that link the descriptors to the bioactivity data. Since its appearance, PCM modelling has developed rapidly over the past decade by taking advantage of the progress of different descriptors and machine learning techniques, along with the increasing amounts of available bioactivity data. Specifically, the new emerging target descriptors and cross-term descriptors not only significantly increased the performance of PCM modelling but also expanded its application scope from traditional protein–ligand interaction to more abundant interactions, including protein–peptide, protein–DNA and even protein–protein interactions. In this review, target descriptors and cross-term descriptors, as well as the corresponding application scope, are intensively summarized. Additionally, we look forward to seeing PCM modelling extend into new application scopes, such as Target-Catalyst-Ligand systems, with the further development of descriptors, machine learning techniques and increasing amounts of available bioactivity data.},

    abstract = { Nanomaterials regulators need good information to make good decisions. Nanomaterials and their interactions with biology are very complex. Computational methods use existing data to predict properties of new nanomaterials. Statistical, data driven modelling methods have been successfully applied to this task. Much more must be learnt before robust toolkits will be widely usable by regulators. Nanomaterials research is one of the fastest growing contemporary research areas. The unprecedented properties of these materials have meant that they are being incorporated into products very quickly. Regulatory agencies are concerned they cannot assess the potential hazards of these materials adequately, as data on the biological properties of nanomaterials are still relatively limited and expensive to acquire. Computational modelling methods have much to offer in helping understand the mechanisms by which toxicity may occur, and in predicting the likelihood of adverse biological impacts of materials not yet tested experimentally. This paper reviews the progress these methods, particularly those QSAR-based, have made in understanding and predicting potentially adverse biological effects of nanomaterials, and also the limitations and pitfalls of these methods.},

"Another possible option would be to upload datasets generated using these resources into the eNanoMapper database [31,118,119]. This might be achieved via using the eNanoMapper customisable Excel spreadsheet parser to extract data from the Excel files created directly using the NanoPUZZLES templates [120]. Alternatively, it might be possible for an ISA-TAB-Nano parser (under development within eNanoMapper at the time of writing) to parse the tab-delimited text files generated using the program described in section 5. In either case the mapping of the input files onto the internal eNanoMapper data model would be performed in a transparent way, either explicitly via a JSON configuration file or implicitly by the ISA-TAB-Nano parser [31].

A brief illustration of some of the functionality of the nanoDMS database and its use for querying data generated using the NanoPUZZLES templates and business rules is presented in Figures 3–7. However, it should be noted that an in-depth discussion of the complete functionality of the nanoDMS and eNanoMapper databases is beyond the scope of the current paper.

number of well-documented and technically advanced models

thoroughly documented database, based on: (1) an advanced
evaluation of physicochemical properties of nanoparticles and in
silico modelling of their reactivity; and (2) assessment of the
characterisation methodologies as well as toxicity protocols used
to develop biological responses in toxicological studies. Datasets
were evaluated for a number of quality criteria and internal
consistency as a condition for inclusion. The evaluation stage was
followed by development of toxicity models based at the
individual organism level, using statistical and mechanistic models,
in parallel with models predicting environmental fate. The toxicity
and fate models were integrated in mechanistic models to predict
the long term risks of engineered nanoparticles for populations
under realistic environmental conditions. The risk assessment
framework was developed using results from the project's new
models.},

@article{citeulike:13763677,
    abstract = {Background
Assessing the impact of new technologies or newly developed substances on our environment is a challenge, even more so if the applied test methods - both toxicological and analytical - are often found to be inadequate and need amendments or even new developments as it is in the case of nanotechnology. This is illustrated by numerous publications in the field of nano-ecotoxicology which although they have been investigating the impact of a number of nanomaterials on several organisms almost never allow for explicit statements on potential hazards of these nanomaterials. This fact not only hampers the knowledge communication to all non-scientists (e.g. consumers) but it also complicates the transfer of the obtained results for other scientists.

Results
Risk communication is an essential and thus integral part of risk management. For this purpose, the project DaNa2.0 (Data and knowledge on nanomaterials - processing of socially relevant scientific facts) provides processed and hence easy accessible information on the potential safety issues of nanomaterials, mainly via the project website www.nanoobjects.info webcite. This will allow various stakeholder groups to get impartial information on potential effects of nanomaterials and help consumers to make informed decisions. DaNa2.0 is funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) and supported by the Swiss government as well as by the European InterReg IVb programme. The DaNa2.0 team is an interdisciplinary group of scientists from different areas such as materials science, chemistry, biology and human and environmental toxicology. Extending the project team in DaNa2.0 with European experts allows for broadening of the existing knowledge portfolio by adding further cross-cutting topics and increasing our expertise, e.g. in the field of environmental exposure and fate.

Conclusions
On the project website www.nanoobjects.info webcite, a unique link between nanomaterials in practical applications (e.g. environmental remediation) and their potential impacts is provided. The focus of this publication will be on all issues with environmental relevance, which are addressed in the `Knowledge Base Nanomaterials¿ on the project website. These issues include environmental exposure and behaviour of nanomaterials and nano-ecotoxicology.},
